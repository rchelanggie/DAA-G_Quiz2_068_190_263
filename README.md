## Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using Minimax Algorithm
### Introduction
#### We opted for the utilization of the Minimax algorithm; this algorithm falls under the category of Adversarial Search, which is employed when there exists an adversary or opponent that consistently alters the problem's state in an unfavorable manner at each step. The program needs to account for the subsequent state influenced by the opponent, which cannot be accurately predicted. This search algorithm is capable of handling both general games and zero-sum games.
We selected the problem of Tic-tac-toe for our project, as it is a game that aligns well with the capabilities of the Minimax algorithm. This algorithm is specifically designed to tackle zero-sum games, such as Tic-tac-toe, and it lends itself to clear and straightforward demonstrations, making it easy to comprehend.

### Conclusion
#### The key to the Minimax algorithm is the back and forth between the two players, where the player in turn wants to choose the move with the maximum score. In turn, the score for each available move is determined by the opposing player which decides which of the available moves has the minimum score. And the score for the opposing player's moves is again determined by that player taking turns trying to maximize his score and so on until down the tree moves to the end state. For having the AI with a minimax algorithm, thus making the game “unbeatable”.
